# TickSystem-

Using C# I have created a ticket system with log in form and registration for the chashier for the premier league Telkom Cup.

 1 - The system have two cashier who are supposed to log in as senior cashier and junior cashier. 
2 The Senior cashier can use the system to ticket spectators that come in all the stages while a junior cashier can use the system to ticket childern in the group stages and quarter finals only and adults in all stages. 
3 - The log in form is  linked to the main form. 
4 - Therre are  two textbox controls for adults and children, four label controls, three button controls, 1 group box, four radio button controls
. 5 - The Clear button resets the radio buttons to clear, empities the textbox controls and resets the total label.  


Based on the requirements,  a step-by-step plan i followed through:

Create a splash form that appears before the login form.
Create a login form with fields for username and password.
Validate the login details. If they are correct, display a success message and link to the main form.
In the main form, create two textboxes for adults and children, four labels, three buttons, one group box, and four radio buttons.
Implement the functionality for the senior cashier to ticket spectators in all stages.
Implement the functionality for the junior cashier to ticket children in the group stages and quarter finals only, and adults in all stages.
Implement the functionality for the Clear button to reset the radio buttons, empty the textbox controls, and reset the total label.



N.B:  That was created Using Visual code. 
Requires certain extensions as in order to have i running like:
Dotnet 
C# Dev Kit 
Apache subversion 
Csproj 
And others
